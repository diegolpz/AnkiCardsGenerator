* Introduction
This little script generates anki cards to study russian.
What it does is for each pair "russianTranslation,word,tags" it generates a anki card that has in one side the word and in the other the transltion of that word, the audio, the IPA transliteratio and the table of declensions
To do that it uses a web scrapper to clean the info in the wiktionaty and embedd the respective html code to the anki card and format it in a csv file.
So shout outs to wiktionay
The output file "out.csv" is formated to de imported by anki with the html intrepreter checked
