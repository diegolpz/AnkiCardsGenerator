* Introduction
This little script generates anki cards to study russian.
What it does is for each pair "russianTranslation,word,tags,example,exampleTranslation" it generates a anki card that has in one side the word and in the other the transltion of that word, the audio, the IPA transliteratio, an example and the table of declensions
To do that it uses a web scrapper to clean up the info in the wiktionaty and embedd the respective html code to the anki card and format it in a csv file.
So shout outs to wiktionay
The output file "out.csv" is formated to be imported by anki with the html intrepreter checked

* Dependencies
1. GNU utilities
2. Python 3
3. Beautiful soup
4. Python html parser
5. csvtools

* Usage
Just run AnkiCardsGenerator script with input the name of a file which include all the pairs "translation,word,tags,example,exampleTranslation" you want, each on a single line.
Check the file RuEn.csv for the formant.
To check how it works just run "./Ankicardsgenerator RuEn.csv" and then import out.csv to anki as a csv file, make sure to check the html interpreter of anki and use the basic card format.
The adition of example is optional, the example is linked to the yandex translator in order to get the speach synthesis. If you are using the anki app I suggest to install the yandex translator app bacause it has a better speach synth.
